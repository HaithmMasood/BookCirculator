# BookCirculator

## Overview
BookCirculator is a Java project developed for COMP 249 - Object-Oriented Programming II at Concordia University. This project demonstrates proficiency in handling files, inner classes, ArrayLists, and Linked Lists. It focuses on processing and managing a collection of Book records, distinguishing between correctly and incorrectly recorded publication years, and performing various operations on these records.

## Features
- **Book Record Management**: Efficiently handles records of published books, including sorting and filtering based on publication year.
- **Error Handling**: Identifies and separates records with incorrect publication years.
- **Data Structures**: Utilizes ArrayLists for incorrect records and a Circular Linked List for correct records.
- **Dynamic Operations**: Provides functionality for adding, deleting, and searching records, as well as creating specialized lists (e.g., books by a specific author).
- **File Processing**: Reads from and writes processed data back to files, demonstrating file handling capabilities.

## Installation
To run this application, ensure you have Java installed on your system. Clone the repository, navigate to the source directory, and run the main Java file.

## Structure
- **Book Class**: Represents a book record with attributes like title, author, ISBN, etc.
- **Node Class**: Basic unit for the Circular Linked List implementation.
- **CircularBookList Class**: Manages the circular linked list operations.
- **Driver Class**: Main class to run the application and demonstrate functionality.

## Documentation
All classes and methods are documented using JavaDoc standards for easy understanding and maintenance.

## Contributions
This project is an assignment and not open for external contributions. However, feedback and suggestions are welcome.
